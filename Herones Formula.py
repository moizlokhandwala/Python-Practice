# Expected output
# Student should look at the following comments and compare to printed output.

#A triangle with vertices (0,0), (3,4), and (1,1) has an area of 0.5.
#A triangle with vertices (-2,4), (1,6), and (2,1) has an area of 8.5.
#A triangle with vertices (10,0), (0,0), and (0,10) has an area of 50.
